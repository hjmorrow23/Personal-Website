I love to play basketball as well as any other sport for fun. I have lived in 4 different countries and 4 different states over my life. </p>

					   <p>My interest in development started in college, but blossomed at my former position when I volunteered to learn more about HTML and CSS to help with the office's new website initiative. I continued learning Javascript and other technologies to help build better experiences. Now I am able to use what I have learned to develop my professional web presence and help others do the same.</p>
