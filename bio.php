					   <p>My interest in development started in college, but blossomed at my current job when I was selected as a tech savvy member of the recruiting team to learn more about HTML and CSS to help with the office's new website initiative. I'm devoted to continue learning new things as long as I live. Now I am able to use what I have learned to develop my professional web presence.</p>
